I am building my own set of resources for use in this course. I found these databases via the book:
"Practical Data Science with R" by Zumel and Mount.
Another useful book: "R Graphics" by P. Murrell
I will try to do as many examples and problems with these two books and document here.
This is in no way connected with Project Assignments in the JHU course, just backup information.
