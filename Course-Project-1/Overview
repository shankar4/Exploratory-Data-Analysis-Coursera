This has four subfolders one each for the four plots required.
plot1 was done differently as I was still learning how to remove factors from read in data
The data has columns with string entries which are automatically declared as factor levels.
This had to be removed so they could be viewed as characters and eventually turned into numerics for plot1.
plot2 turns off that option upfront before reading in data.
This was useful in also dealing with dates in the lubridate package
